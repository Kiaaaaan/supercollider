supercollider
=============

I am just starting to learn SuperCollider, which I want to use for algorithmic music composition. 

The primary purpose of this repo is for backup. As I am a beginner, you may not learn much from my code. It may be horribly badly written, be poorly documented, cause your speakers to blow up, or offend your aesthetic sensibilities. Of course, this code comes with no warranty. Read and use at your own risk.
